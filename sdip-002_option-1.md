## SDIP-002: SDOG Investor Value Recovery and Future DAO Viability Alignment Proposal

### Option 1: Warrant/Option Feature

#### General Assumptions Underpinning this Option

1. SDOG superficially reclassified as a warrant token issued as part of the initial public funding round lasting 8 days (hosted by SnowbankDAO). 
2. ALL SDOG holders are considered henceforth public investors in SDAO and provided the initial seed capital (noting that >95% of which SnowbankDAO misappropriated, and legal recourse and/or recovery lag may be significant, and uncertain);
3. SDOGs trading in the secondary market are warrant tokens from (1), trading without any restrictions, and accessible to past and future (potential) investors.

#### Proposal

This approach seeks to treat SDOG as a precursor derivative of SD2. SDOG token holders will have the right to mint SD2 by burning SDOG and providing the intrinsic value of SD2. 

For example, an SDOG investor would provide 1 MIM and 1 SDOG to mint 1 SD2. Thus it only makes sense to the investor to redeem when SD2 price is above intrinsic value. The purchase price of this derivative was different for each investor; introducing a dynamic ‘strike price’ that is largely at the discretion of the investor.

Further, in order to ensure incentives are aligned with the long term success of SDAO, SDOG is also considered vested based on the supply of SD2 at a rate of 1%. This means that at 1 million SD2 supply, a maximum of 10,000 SDOGs can be redeemed. At approximately 7 million SD2 supply, all circulating supply of SDOGs will be eligible for redemption. As the protocol grows, the potential upside for SDOG investors is significant under this proposal, from the current valuation levels.

#### Scenario Analysis

Assumptions:  

Reference stable coin: MIM  
SD2 Supply: 1,000,000  
SDOG Vested: 10,000 (1% x SD2 supply)  
RFV: $2,000,000  
MV of Treasury (MVT): $10,000,000  
Intrinsic Value (IV) per SD2: $10  
Risk Free Price (RFP) per SD2: $2  
SD2 Market Price: $30 (assume 3x MVT)

Investor actions under this scenario:  

- SDOG Investor holdings: 5 SDOG  
- Cost of exercising warrant: 5 SDOG plus 50 MIM (5 x IV)  
- Investor receives: 5 SD2 (market value $150)  

SD2 treasury actions under this scenario:  

- Mint 5 SD2 and then autostake for investor  
- Burn 5 SDOG  
- Add 50 MIM to treasury Risk Free Assets (RFA) pool.  

#### Summary of Option 1

All SDOG holders are considered 'whitelisted' and seed investors in SDAO. If SD2 is trading at US$30 with an intrinsic value of US$10, SDOG investors will have the option to burn 1 SDOG and pay $10 MIM for 1 SD2. SD2 treasury will burn the SDOGs upon exercise and add the MIM to its RFA pool.

At an equilibrium valuation, we expect the floor price of SDOG to converge towards the price of SD2 minus the intrinsic value. If SDOGs were to trade below this valuation then a clear arbitrage will exist thus triggering a market driven pull to parity. Over a sufficient time horizon, this approach will recover value for SDOG holders whilst enabling the SD2 protocol to grow and succeed.

SDOGs will be considered a perpetual warrant honored by SDAO. Anybody, at any time, subject to vesting limitations, if holding SDOGs, will be able to pay the intrinsic value of SD2, burn SDOGs and receive SD2. Exercise of the warrant is entirely at the discretion of the holder.
